# Title:
Enhancing Online Proctoring Security through Keylogger-assisted Monitoring

# Abstract:

This project introduces a keylogger-based solution to enhance online proctoring systems by discreetly capturing user keystrokes during exams. The system uses the pynput library to monitor and log keyboard events, extracting meaningful information and analyzing the data. It also uses Google Translate to translate captured text into English, providing real-time insights into potential academic misconduct. This innovative approach reinforces monitoring capabilities and promotes a more secure online examination environment.
